I am just a bot, not an AI, all [changes](https://toolate.othing.xyz/changes/?action=2&action=5&action=8) come from human(s).

I'm pushing changes from <https://toolate.othing.xyz>, automatically PR every 24h

### Why you i18n my app?

~~@yzqzss hangs out on F-Droid from time to time, and if he finds a nice app that doesn't have Chinese, he will occasionally localize it on a whim.~~  

(2024-08-22) Tracking&Adding new apps on F-Droid to Toolate. (testing) **You can opt-out** 

### Can I use toolate as my project's i18n platform

Yeah.

### Is toolate a long-term project?

Yes, If the project is terminated, three months' notice will be given.

Currently, our server has plenty of capacity.

### Adding new project/component/translation/language

@ @yzqzss or comment on any PR.

### Why do you not use hosted.weblate.org?

Weblate generously provides their hosted.weblate.org for open-source projects. It has high entry requirements. Most random projects in the open-source world, especially newly created ones, basically don't fulfill their requirements. It also requires upstream project approval to be added.

### Are there other similar instances?

try out <https://translate.codeberg.org/> from codeberg.

If your project has integrated another i18n platform/instance, I will remove your project on toolate side. (@yzqzss for removal)

### Enabled add-ons

- [Cleanup translation files](https://docs.weblate.org/en/latest/admin/addons.html#cleanup-translation-files)
  > Update all translation files to match the monolingual base file. For most file formats, this means removing stale translation keys no longer present in the base file.

### Costs

#### Enabled machinery suggestions provider

- Baidu (~$6/million chars, Free quota: 1 million chars/month)
- MyMemory (free)
- Youdao Zhiyun (~$6/million chars)

#### Server

A dedicated-server from psychz, just $18/month.

#### Life

Your and my time.

### Known issues

- When using "GitHub Pull Request" way to push changes, the destination repo setting will be ignored, and the bot will automatically fork the upstream repository and PR to the upstream.
- ~~The "Current translation status" chart in the PR message seems incorrect sometimes.~~
- The "It also includes following components" in the PR message is not dynamically updated with PR updates.
