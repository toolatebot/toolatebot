### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

admin: [@yzqzss](https://github.com/yzqzss).

I am just a bot, not an AI, all changes come from human(s). (currently, only @yzqzss)

I'm pushing changes from https://toolate.othing.xyz

You can [add the bot as a collaborator](https://github.com/toolatebot/github-accept-all-collabs) to give it push commit permission, this is useful if you are a translator and want to set the destination repo as your fork repo to review changes before you PR upstream repo. (If this weblate instance has a second user besides @yzqzss :)
